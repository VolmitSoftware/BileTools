Tools for making garbage

## What the hell does this do?
* Any plugin jar files modified while loaded (maven compile or export or even drag/drop) are automatically reloaded. So now all you have to do is smack the run button and bam, its already in the game without reloading, dragging or really doing anything. Psst... Works best with multiple momitors.
* New Plugins are hot-dropped into the server when they are added to the plugins folder
* It's basically plugman also. You can unload load and reload plugins.
